<p>Acknowledgement.  IMPORTANT NOTICE: PHIL’S FONTS/GARAGEFONTS “LICENSOR” IS<br>
WILLING TO LICENSE ITS FONT SOFTWARE TO ANY BUSINESS ENTITY OR INDIVIDUAL “LICENSEE” ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT LICENSEE ACCEPTS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>THIS IS A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE LICENSEE AND THE LICENSOR. THIS TRANSACTION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SALE OF THE PHIL’S FONTS/GARAGEFONTS FONT SOFTWARE —  IT IS A LICENSE TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. BY PLACING AN ORDER FOR AND ACCEPTING PHIL’S FONTS/GARAGEFONTS FONT SOFTWARE (ELECTRONIC FONT SOFTWARE), OR BY DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE AND CLICKING THE “YES, I AGREE” BUTTON (OR SIMILAR ONLINE ACCEPTANCE MECHANISM) ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENSE, LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS READ ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTANDS THEM, AND AGREES TO BE<br>
BOUND BY THEM. IF LICENSEE DOES NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, LICENSEE MUST PROMPTLY CEASE USE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT. LICENSEE MUST IMMEDIATELY DELETE ANY PORTION OF THE FONT SOFTWARE INSTALLED ON LICENSEE’S COMPUTER(S).</p>
<p>THIS LICENSE SUPERSEDES ALL PHIL’S FONTS/GARAGEFONTS END USER LICENSE<br>
AGREEMENTS. PHIL’S FONTS/GARAGEFONTS ADVISES LICENSEE TO PRINT OUT A COPY OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND SAVE IT FOR YOUR RECORDS. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONTRACTUAL AND BINDING IN NATURE, AND NOT MERE RECITATIONS. ONCE THE FONT SOFTWARE LICENSE HAS BEEN PURCHASED, THE SOFTWARE IS NONRETURNABLE, AND THE LICENSE FEE IS NONREFUNDABLE.</p>
<p>- Software means the computer program contained in this package (which may include<br>
digitally encoded, machine readable, scalable outline font data as encoded in special<br>
format), together with all codes, techniques, software tools, formats, designs, concepts,<br>
methods and ideas associated with the computer program and all documentation related<br>
thereto.</p>
<p>Please refer to important information  regarding Permitted Uses  and Special Font<br>
Licensing  requirements in Sections 5, 6, 7, 8  and 9.</p>
<p>1. Third-Party Purchasing Agent.  If you are acting as a third-party purchasing agent for<br>
a business or organization, you represent and warrant that the business or organization for<br>
which you are acting has consented to this Agreement. You further agree that as a thirdparty<br>
purchasing agent for a business or organization, you have no rights to use the Font<br>
Software whatsoever, but you agree to be bound by the Agreement in its entirety as if you<br>
were the end user.</p>
<p>2. Grant of Desktop Publishing License.  In consideration of payment of the<br>
nonrefundable license fee, included in the price paid by the Licensee for this product, the<br>
Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use this product,<br>
which consists of electronic font software to display and output PostScript®, TrueType® or<br>
OpenType® typefaces. Any use other than Desktop will require additional licensing . This<br>
font software may be installed on up to five (5) CPUs for Desktop Publishing . If Licensee<br>
is using this product with more than five (5) CPUs, Licensee is required to obtain a MultiUser<br>
Desktop Publishing License for the appropriate number of CPUs/Users. (See Multi-<br>
User Desktop Publishing Licenses section below).<br>
 When Licensee orders GarageFonts library  fonts through Phil’s Fonts, Inc. , or it’s<br>
resellers, distributors or third-party licensing agents, Licensee is able to purchase Multi-User<br>
Desktop Publishing License(s) at the same time.</p>
<p>2 (a). License Extensions.  Licensee is able to add additional Multi-User Desktop<br>
Publishing Licenses for the same font products . You may not, however, downgrade your<br>
license once you have made your purchase. The entire license will be governed by the<br>
License Agreement in affect at the time of the latest extension .</p>
<p>2 (b). Server Use.<br>
 The Font Software may not be installed or used on an internal or external (i.e., internet<br>
accessed) server unless all Workstations that can access such server are part of a Licensed<br>
Unit. For the purpose of determining the proper number of Workstations for which a license<br>
is needed, the following example is supplied for illustration purposes only: If there are 100<br>
Workstations connected to the server, with no more than 15 Workstations ever using the<br>
Font Software concurrently, but the Font Software will be used on 25 different Workstations<br>
at various points in time, a license must be obtained which creates a Licensed Unit for 25<br>
Workstations.</p>
<p>2 (c). Multi-User Desktop Publishing Licenses.  Phil’s Fonts/GarageFonts calculates<br>
Multi-User Desktop Publishing License  fees based on the Recommended End User Price<br>
times the number of CPUs or Users, (whichever is the greater).<br>
The maximum number of CPUs licensed is equal to the number of users selected in the<br>
applicable receipt. Please retain that receipt as proof.</p>
<p>Number Price<br>
of CPUs/Users Multiplier</p>
<p>1-5 price x 1<br>
6-25 price x 2<br>
26-50 price x 3<br>
50-75 price x 4<br>
76-125 price x 5<br>
126-175 price x 6<br>
176-250 price x 7<br>
251-375 price x 9.5<br>
376-500 price x 11<br>
501-625 price x 13.5<br>
626-750 price x 16<br>
751-875 price x 18.5<br>
876-1000 price x 21</p>
<p>If Licensee’s Multi-User Desktop Publishing Licensing requirements exceed the chart above,<br>
please contact Phil’s Fonts/GarageFonts or one their Authorized Distributors or Resellers for<br>
additional information.</p>
